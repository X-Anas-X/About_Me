                <h3>Black Holes </h3>
                <p>
                    a black hole is anything but empty space. 
                    Rather, it is a great amount of matter packed into a very small area - 
                    think of a star ten times more massive than the Sun squeezed into a sphere approximately 
                    the diameter of New York City. The result is a gravitational field so strong that nothing, 
                    not even light, can escape. In recent years, NASA instruments have painted a new picture of these 
                    strange objects that are, to many, the most fascinating objects in space.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>
                    One Star's End is a Black Hole's Beginning
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Most black holes form from the remnants of a large star that dies in a 
                    supernova explosion. (Smaller stars become dense neutron stars,
                     which are not massive enough to trap light.) If the total mass of 
                     the star is large enough (about three times the mass of the Sun), 
                     it can be proven theoretically that no force can keep the star from collapsing 
                     under the influence of gravity. However, as the star collapses, a strange thing occurs.
                      As the surface of the star nears an imaginary surface called the "event horizon,
                      " time on the star slows relative to the time kept by observers far away. When the surface
                       reaches the event horizon, time stands still, and the star can collapse no more -
                        it is a frozen collapsing object.
                </p>
            <div>

                </h5>
                <p>
                    Although the basic formation process is understood, 
                    one perennial mystery in the science of black holes is that they appear 
                    to exist on two radically different size scales.
                     On the one end, there are the countless black holes that are the remnants of
                      massive stars. Peppered throughout the Universe, these "stellar mass" b
                      lack holes are generally 10 to 24 times as massive as the Sun. 
                      Astronomers spot them when another star draws near enough for some of
                       the matter surrounding it to be snared by the black hole's gravity, 
                       churning out x-rays in the process. Most stellar black holes, howeve
                       r, lead isolated lives and are impossible to detect. Judging from the 
                       number of stars large enough to produce such black holes, however, 
                       scientists estimate that there are as many as ten million to a billion
                        such black holes in the Milky Way alone.
